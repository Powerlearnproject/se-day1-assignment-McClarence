# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- Software Engineering is systematic application of engineering principles to develop and maintain high quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- Development of programming languages
- Establishment of software engineering discipline
- Agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Requirement - Enquire about what the users need and system requirements for the software
- Design      - Create detailed software architecture
- Implementation - Write code to build the software according to specifications
- Testing    - test the software to meet quality standards
- Deployment - launch or release the software to the users
- Maintenance - continuous support, update and enhancements


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software Developer - write code to implement software solutions
- Quality Assurance Engineer - test the software to meet quality standards and functional requirements
- Project Manager  - Oversees the project from start to finish

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide an environment to write code. eg, Visual Studio Code
- Version Control Systems (VCS) tracks changes to source code. eg, git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges
- Tight deadlines
- technical debt
- changing requirements

Strategies
- Employ agile methodologies
- Effective communication
- Prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is performed to test individual components of the software.
Integration testing tests the interaction between different components. 
System testing tests the entire software. It helps to produce standard and functional software.
Acceptance Testing tests the software against user requirements. It checks if user needs are met.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

-Prompt engineering is the act of crafting questions and statements to get the specific and needed responses from AI.
Prompt engineering plays a major role in getting accurate solutions to problems when dealing with AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt
- "Tell me about a software engineer"
Improved prompt
- "Tell me about the role of a software engineer"

The improved version will provide more specific answer as to who a software engineer is and the job a software engineer does.
